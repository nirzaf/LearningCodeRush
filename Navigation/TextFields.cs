		CodeRush Text Fields are like temporary input fields inside your code. They 
		allow you to quickly specify values for newly generated code.

		![](TextFields;;;0.02866,0.02866)

		When you navigate to a text field, its contents are selected, so you can 
		simply type the new value you need to replace the selection. 
		
		Press Enter to accept your change, and CodeRush will move you to the next 
		Text Field (or to a location that otherwise makes sense).

		You can also navigate among Text Fields (when a Text Field is active) by 
		pressing Tab or Shift+Tab.

		Pro Tip: Ctrl+Shift+Enter accepts all text fields.                       */
