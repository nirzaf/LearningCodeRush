//`++Welcome to the Learning CodeRush Solution!
/*
This project contains source files and examples to help you learn CodeRush 
features, as well as shortcuts to invoke them.

To start the first lesson, click below:

	![](BtnCapsSpaceTrim;crcommand:OpenFile:CapsSpace.cs;;0.012,0.012) << Caps+Space to toggle code


Or for a lesson overview:

	![](BtnAllLessons;crcommand:OpenFile:AllLessonsCapsModifier.cs;;0.012,0.012) << in this project


While examples in this project show how to **instantly** refactor code, all 
refactorings can be accessed with Ctrl+. (to bring up Visual Studio's Code 
Action menu).                                                                 */
